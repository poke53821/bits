How to enable SSH login to gitlab using key instead of user name and password?

1. generate a key pair from your local environment;
   $ssh-keygen -o -t rsa -b 4096 -C "xxxx@gmail.com"
2. now you got two files: id_rsa (private key) and id_rsa.pub (public key) in your home folder (~/.ssh)
3. browse to gitlab.com, login and navigate to user settings (top right corner)
4. paste the content of your public key to gitlab user settings
5. from your working environment, try to clone your project (see below for example), and you shouldn't be prompted for user credential anymore.

$git clone git@gitlab.com:whoissqr/mini-js-express.git
